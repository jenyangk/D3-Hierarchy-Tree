# D3 Hierarchy Tree

This project is a simple demonstration of my Angular implementation of Mike Bostock's [Collapsible Tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/collapsible-tree?collection=@d3/d3-hierarchy). This is one of many ways to implement D3 onto Angular.

However, since I'm merely updating the state of nodes and links, I'm not able to show animations when collapsing or expanding a node.
